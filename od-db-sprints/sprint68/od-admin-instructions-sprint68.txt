Check the DECODEs for the following IMs: 
	Model Map Import v1


Additional Notes:
1. If there is a need to update the interchange mappings for PV VM Import or PV VM Update, the Python Transformations must be re-entered otherwise the system will throw an error (there is a bug where the script is only partially saved when you navigate to the mapping step). For either IM, copy/paste the code below into the Python Transformation pop-up for the 'PV' column. You should then be able to save the IM.

	def transform_input(string_list):
	auxiliary_list = [(x, unicode(x,'UTF-8')) for x in string_list]
	uni_list = [(y, y[1].replace(u'\u00A0','')) for y in auxiliary_list]
	return [y[1] for y in uni_list]
