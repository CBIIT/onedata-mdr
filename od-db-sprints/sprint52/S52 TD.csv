CUSTOM LOOKUP,Target Functions,"Returns the permissible value for the target characteristic that maps to the source characteristic permissible value. Used when a custom function must be developed to derive the mapping. Example 1: one of the source / target characteristics is enumerated by reference whereas the other has permissible values from an external terminology, such as ICD-O, stored in caDSR. Example 2: one of the source / target characteristics is enumerated by reference whereas the other has permissible values from a “locally” developed list stored in caDSR. Parameter: SOURCE (source characteristic permissible value).",,,CHARLESYDEV,02/05/2024 08:30,02/05/2024 08:30,CHARLESYDEV
XLOOKUP,Target Functions,"Returns the permissible value for the target characteristic that maps to the source characteristic permissible value. Used when both the source and target characteristics are enumerated by reference, i.e., their permissible values mapping is NOT stored in caDSR, therefore, an external mapping reference must be consulted. Parameters: (source characteristic vocabulary name, source characteristic permissible value, target characteristic vocabulary name).",,,CHARLESYDEV,02/05/2024 08:29,02/02/2024 14:03,DWARZEL
LOOKUP,Target Functions,"Returns the permissible value for the target characteristic that maps to the source characteristic permissible value.
