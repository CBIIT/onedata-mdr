<P><font color="blue"><B>caDSR II</B>  Release 1.38.1.0 was released on November 7th, 2022 and includes the following:</font><p>
<UL class=multi>
   <li><b>URL Link</b> is a new capability that provides a unique URL for each <b>CDE and Form</b> that can be copied from caDSR UI's such as in <b>Data Element - View/Browse and Forms Favorites</b> and shared with others. When pasted into a web browser window it will open directly to the CDE or Form with the ability to click and view the details of the CDE or Form. <p>To support this feature we added a new field <b>"Link"</b> into the item's details, and we also added a new search field to <b>Forms' Favorite search filter - Version</b> to support searching for form by it's version.</li>
 <li>A new Download Collection: <B>Form Review</b> providing an Excel download where all fields are presented in a single column format.</li>
<li>Minor fixes to reports for bulk loading via the Delivery Options for <b> Summary Reports</b> and <b>Download to Excel.</b></li>
<li>Fixes to <b>Form Data Audit</b> and <b>Data Audit</b>, features that allows logged in users to view changes to caDSR content.</li></p>
<p>As always, see the link to all caDSR II Release Notes. </p>
            <B>caDSR II</B> provides access to NCI's metadata content: Common Data Elements (CDEs), Case Report Forms (CRFs), and Data Models describing how to collect standardized data.
        </P>
        <P>
            The "Links to Favorites" section <B>Data Elements - View/Browse</b> provides access to NCI's CDEs and <b>Forms</b> provides access to our CRFs. It also includes links for browsing or searching specific collections of content using various "Child Filters".
<P>Favorites also includes:
 <UL class="multi">
<LI><b>Browse CDEs by Data Element Concept: </b>
The CDE's Data Element Concept (DEC) is essentially the "question" being asked, the CDE's Value Domain (VD) defines the permitted values for capturing the response to the question. CDEs can share the same DEC but have a different VD for example where either the number of permitted values is different, or the way the response to the question is recorded is represented differently. Browsing CDEs by DEC allows you to find the question you want to ask (DEC) and then view/compare existing CDEs, including comparing each CDEs permitted values to help determine if there is CDE you can reuse.  
</li>
<li><b>NCI Standard CRFs </B>This favorite displays the set of standardized Case Report Forms used across NCI Clinical Trials.</li>
