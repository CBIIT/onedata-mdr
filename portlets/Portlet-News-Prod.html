<P><font color="blue"><B>caDSR II</B> Release 1.42.x.0 is an enhancement release with the following new features:
</font><p>
<UL class=multi>
<li><p><b>Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) Standard Data Elements</b></p><p>This new Favorite displays the CRDC Data Element Standards. Along with all the details of CDEs you might expect, the landing page displays the CDEs using the CRDC name, Domain, Examples, Coding Instructions and other important details! The CRDC is working on data standards to address commonality across the CRDC nodes for clinical data. Be sure to check it out!
</p></li>
<li><p><b>Browse CDEs by Classification</B></p><p>This new Favorite is intended to replace the CDE Browser navigation tree. While slightly different, for example counts are offered for the number of distinct CDEs in a Context or Classification node, it offers a way to discover CDEs in a familiar way, similar to the legacy CDE Browser. There isn't a "search within" at this time, but you can download the CDEs in Legacy Excel, Prior Excel, and CDE XML using a shortcut link rather than having to put the CDEs into a cart and use Download Collection. Further improvements will be in future releases.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Browse CDEs by Protocol Forms</b></p><p>This replaces the "Protocol Forms" node in the CDE Browser Context tree. It functions similar to the Browser CDEs by Classifications. In addition to this we added a new Node and Child filter named "7.1 Associated Protocols" to the <i>Data Element - View/Browse</i> 
Favorite to display tor retrieve CDEs associated with Protocol Forms.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Download CDEs from User Carts</b></p><p>We have added a shortcut link to download CDEs directly from Guest User Cart, Named User Cart, and the default User Cart for customers with caDSR II accounts. This streamlines getting Legacy CDE Browser Excel, Prior CDE Browser Excel, and Legacy CDE XML downloads.></li>
</ul>
<p>As always, this release also has bug fixes and other improvements. For details, refer to the <a class="underline" href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/Zwd-Gw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caDSR II Release Notes</a>.</p>
 <p><B>caDSR II</B> provides access to NCI's metadata standards for: Common Data Elements (CDEs), Case Report Forms (CRFs), and Data Models. These metadata resources describe a common way of structuring and understanding data.
        </P>
        <P>The "Links to Favorites" section <B>Data Elements - View/Browse</b> provides access to NCI's CDEs and <b>Forms</b> provides access to our CRFs. It also includes links for browsing or searching specific collections of content using various "Child Filters".
