<P><B>caDSR II</B> Release 1.35.3.0 went into production Sept. 07, 2022 with three bug fixes, two for the caDSR II APIs and one for ALS Form Download. Please see the link to full Release Notes. </p>
<p>A few highlights are <B>VM Match</B> that takes in a list of valid value labels and suggests NCIt concepts, and enhancements to <B>CDE Match</B> that uses column headers or question text and valid values if they exist to identify existing CDEs for reuse. </p>
            <B>caDSR II</B> provides access to NCI's metadata content: Common Data Elements (CDEs), Case Report Forms (CRFs), and Data Models describing how to collect standardized data.
        </P>
        <P>
            The "Links to Favorites" section <B>Data Elements - View/Browse</b> provides access to NCI's CDEs and <b>Forms</b> provides access to our CRFs. Links to tools for searching for CDEs and Forms as well as convenience links for browsing or searching specific collections of content using various "Child Filters".
<P>This release includes two new browsing options in Favorites: 
 <UL class="multi">
            <LI><b>Browse CDEs by Data Element Concept: </b>
The CDE's Data Element Concept (DEC) is essentially the "question" being asked, the CDE's Value Domain (VD) defines the permitted values for capturing the response to the question. CDEs can share the same DEC but have a different VD for example where either the number of permitted values is different, or the way the response to the question is recorded is represented differently. Browsing CDEs by DEC allows you to find the question you want to ask (DEC) and then view/compare existing CDEs, including comparing each CDEs permitted values to help determine if there is CDE you can reuse.  
</li>
<li><b>NCI Standard CRFs </B>This favorite displays the set of standardized Case Report Forms used across NCI Clinical Trials.</li>
