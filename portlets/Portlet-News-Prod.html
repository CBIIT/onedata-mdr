<P><font color="blue"><B>caDSR II</B> Release 1.51.5.0 includes the following improvements:</b></font>
<UL class=multi>
<li><p><b>Pediatrics Cancer Core CDEs</B> - This new Favorite displays the CDEs (all statuses) that are being worked on for the Pediatrics Cancer Context.</p></li>
<li><p><b>NIH CDE Governance Submission Download</B> - This new format in the Download Collections feature supports exporting caDSR CDEs in a spreadsheet format that can be inserted into the NIH CDE Submission Template. The templates are submitted to the NIH CDE Governance Committee for review and approval for the "NIH Endorsed" status and will then be included in the NIH CDE Repository. CDEs in the NIH CDE Repository are available to search/use within <i>REDCap</i> systems. NCI Standards CDEs will be submitted for endorsement after the first of the year.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Models and Model Mapping</B> - Continued improvements to the Beta Model Mapping feature for recording transformation rules that can be used by ETL tool vendors to generate their tool specific programming language implementation. We will be testing this with several ETL Tool vendors over the next several months.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As always, this release also has a number of UI improvements and bug fixes. For details, refer to the <a class="underline" href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/Zwd-Gw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">caDSR II Release Notes</a>.</p>
