        </P>
        <P>The "Links to Favorites" section <B>Data Elements - View/Browse</b> provides access to NCI's CDEs and <b>Forms</b> provides access to our CRFs. It also includes links for browsing or searching specific collections of content using various "Child Filters".
<P>Favorites also includes:
 <UL class="multi">
<LI><b>Browse CDEs by Data Element Concept: </b>
The CDE's Data Element Concept (DEC) is essentially the "question" being asked, the CDE's Value Domain (VD) defines the permitted values for capturing the response to the question. CDEs can share the same DEC but have a different VD for example where either the number of permitted values is different, or the way the response to the question is recorded is represented differently. Browsing CDEs by DEC allows you to find the question you want to ask (DEC) and then view/compare existing CDEs, including comparing each CDEs permitted values to help determine if there is CDE you can reuse.  
</li>
<li><b>NCI Standard CRFs </B>This favorite displays the set of standardized Case Report Forms used across NCI Clinical Trials.</li>
