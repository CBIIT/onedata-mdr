<P><font color="blue"><B>caDSR II</B> Release 1.42.5.0 is a patch for an issue when entering multiple ID into an input field. This impacted several places were curators edit and also adding more than one item to a Download Collection using Public IDs.
<p>Release 1.42.4.0 contained the following new features:</b></font></p>
<UL class=multi>
<li><p><font color="blue"><b>Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) Standard Data Elements</b></font></p><p>This favorite replaces the Data Element - View/Browse filter and displays the CRDC Data Element Standards. CRDC specific details of CDEs are displayed including the CRDC CDE name, CRDC definition, subject domain, examples, coding instructions and other important details!
</p></li>
<li><p><b>Browse CDEs by Classification</B></p><p>This is similar to browsing CDEs by Context and “Classification” in the legacy CDE Browser navigation tree. Distinct CDE counts, descriptions of the Context and the Classifications are displayed at each level. This new feature also allows customers to download the CDEs at each node in Legacy CDE Excel, Prior CDE Excel, and Legacy CDE XML format via a shortcut link rather than having to put the CDEs into a cart and use Download Collection. Please use Data Element - View/Browse "5. Classifications" child filter and enter text into search fields for the "search within" capability.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Browse CDEs by Protocol Forms</b></p><p>This is similar to browsing CDEs by Context and "Protocol Forms" in the legacy CDE Browser. It displays CDEs that have been used to create questions on forms that have been associated with Context Protocols. This feature also offers a short cut to download CDEs from each node. In addition to this new Favorite we added a new Child filter "7.1 Associated Protocols" to retrieve CDEs associated with Protocol Forms, and in the CDE Details to view the list of associated Protocol Forms.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Download CDEs from User Carts</b></p><p>We have added a shortcut link to download CDEs directly from Guest User Cart, Named User Cart, and the caDSR II User's Default Cart to streamlines getting Legacy CDE Excel, Prior CDE Excel, and Legacy CDE XML downloads.</li>
</ul>
<p>
As always, this release also has bug fixes and other improvements. For details, refer to the caDSR II Release Notes.

 <p><B>caDSR II</B> provides access to NCI's metadata standards for: Common Data Elements (CDEs), Case Report Forms (CRFs), and Data Models. These metadata resources describe a common way of structuring and understanding data.
        </P>
        <P>The "Links to Favorites" section <B>Data Elements - View/Browse</b> provides access to NCI's CDEs and <b>Forms</b> provides access to our CRFs. It also includes links for browsing or searching specific collections of content using various "Child Filters". 
<P>Favorites also includes:
 <UL class="multi">
<LI><b>Browse CDEs by Data Element Concept: </b>
The CDE's Data Element Concept (DEC) is essentially the "question" being asked, the CDE's Value Domain (VD) defines the permitted values for capturing the response to the question. CDEs can share the same DEC but have a different VD for example where either the number of permitted values is different, or the way the response to the question is recorded is represented differently. Browsing CDEs by DEC allows you to find the question you want to ask (DEC) and then view/compare existing CDEs, including comparing each CDEs permitted values to help determine if there is CDE you can reuse.  
</li>
<li><b>NCI Standard CRFs </B>This favorite displays the set of standardized Case Report Forms used across NCI Clinical Trials.</li>
