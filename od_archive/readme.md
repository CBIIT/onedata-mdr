# OneData Object Archive
This directory serves as a place to store OneData objects, tables, views, etc... that have been deprecated and/or marked for deletion. If the object needs to be restored, the necessary scripts and files to do so should be found here.
## Directory Structure
Each folder should be prefixed with the Jira tracker number assigned to the object to be deleted followed by the name of the object. If multiple objects are to be deleted, then this readme should be updated to include the folder name with its list of objects.
